# Binary_Search_Tree

Binary Search Tree Explorer
An interactive educational project that combines a visual Binary Search Tree (BST) game with search functionality. This project helps users understand BST concepts through hands-on experience with visualization and interactive operations.

Features
🎮 Interactive Game Features
Visual BST Representation: See the binary search tree structure with proper node connections

Interactive Node Operations:

Insert nodes with visual feedback

Delete nodes while maintaining BST properties

Search for nodes with step-by-step visualization

Tree Traversal Visualizations: Watch how different traversal methods work:

In-order traversal

Pre-order traversal

Post-order traversal

Level-order traversal

Balance Operations: Check tree balance and perform balancing operations

🔍 Search & Analysis Tools
Step-by-Step Search: Visualize the search process through the tree

Node Information Panel: Display detailed node properties (value, height, balance factor)

Tree Statistics: Real-time stats including height, node count, and balance status

Comparison Mode: Compare different tree configurations
